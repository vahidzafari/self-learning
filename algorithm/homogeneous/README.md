# Homogeneous data structures

Homogeneous data structures contain similar types of data, such as integers or double values. Homogeneous data structures are used in matrices, as well as tensor and vector mathematics. Tensors are mathematical structures for scalars and vectors. A first-rank tensor is a vector. A vector consists of a row or a column. A tensor with zero rank is a scalar. A matrix is a two-dimensional cluster of numbers. They are all used in scientific analysis.

Tensors are used in material science. They are used in mathematics, physics, mechanics, electrodynamics, and general relativity. Machine learning solutions utilize a tensor data structure. A tensor has properties such as position, shape, and a static size.
