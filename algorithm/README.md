# Algorithms

When we write a computer program, we are generally implementing a method that has been devised previously to solve some problem. This method is often independent of the particular programming language being usedâ€”it is likely to be equally appropriate for many computers and many programming languages. It is the method, rather than the computer program itself, that specifies the steps that we can take to solve the problem.
The term algorithm is used in computer science to describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program. Algorithms are the stuff of computer science: they are central objects of study in the field.
