# Volume

# Volumes in kubernetes allow you to store data outside the container.
# When the container stops, all data on the container itself is lost.
# Persistent Volumes in kubernetes allow you attach a volume to a container that will exists even when the container stops.
# Using volumes, you could deploy applications with state on your cluster.
