// A pointer is the memory address of a variable. You need to dereference a pointer
// in order to get its valueâ€”dereferencing is performed using the * character in
// front of the pointer variable. Additionally, you can get the memory address of
// a normal variable using an & in front of it.
// The main benefit you get from pointers is that passing a variable to a function
// as a pointer (we can call that by reference) does not discard any changes you
// make to the value of that variable inside that function when the function returns.

// Apart from reasons of simplicity, there exist three more reasons for using pointers:
// - Pointers allow you to share data between functions.
// - Pointers are also very handy when you want to tell the difference between
// the zero value of a variable and a value that is not set (nil). This is
// particularly useful with structures because pointers (and therefore pointers
// to structures), can have the nil value, which means that you can compare a
// pointer to a structure with the nil value, which is not allowed for normal
// structure variables.
// - Having support for pointers and, more specifically, pointers to structures
// allows Go to support data structures such as linked lists and binary trees,
// which are widely used in computer science. Therefore, you are allowed to
// define a structure field of a Node structure as Next *Node, which is a pointer
// to another Node structure.
