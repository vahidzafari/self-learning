// Go supports constants, which are variables that cannot change their values.
// In Go const can be either of type string, numeric, boolean, and characters.
// Constants in Go are defined with the help of the const keyword. Generally speaking,
// constants can be either global or local variables. The main benefit you get from using
// constants in your programs is the guarantee that their value will not change during
// program execution. Strictly speaking, the value of a constant variable is defined at
// compile time, not at runtimeâ€”this means that it is included in the binary executable.
// A constant declared within an inner having a same name as constant declared in the outer
// scope will shadow the constant in outer scope.

// const <identifier> <type> = <value>;
