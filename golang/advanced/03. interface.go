// An interface is a Go mechanism for defining behavior that is implemented using a
// set of methods. Interfaces play a key role in Go and can simplify the code of your
// programs when they have to deal with multiple data types that perform the same
// taskâ€”recall that fmt.Println() works for almost all data types. But remember,
// interfaces should not be unnecessarily complex. If you decide to create your own
// interfaces, then you should begin with a common behavior that you want to be used
// by multiple data types.

// Interfaces work with methods on types (or type methods), which are like functions
// attached to given data types, which in Go are usually structures (although we can
// use any data type we want).
// The empty interface is defined as just interface{}. As the empty interface has no
// methods, it means that it is already implemented by all data types.

// In a more formal way, a Go interface type defines (or describes) the behavior of
// other types by specifying a set of methods that need to be implemented for supporting
// that behavior. For a data type to satisfy an interface, it needs to implement all the
// type methods required by that interface. Therefore, interfaces are abstract types
// that specify a set of methods that need to be implemented so that another type
// can be considered an instance of the interface. So, an interface is two things: a set
// of methods and a type.
