// The Go standard library includes encoding/json, which is for working with JSON data.
// Additionally, Go allows you to add support for JSON fields in Go structures using
// tags, which is the subject of the Structures and JSON subsection. Tags control
// the encoding and decoding of JSON records to and from Go structures.

// ## Using Marshal() and Unmarshal()
// Both the marshaling and unmarshaling of JSON data are important procedures for working with
// JSON data using Go structures. Marshaling is the process of converting a Go structure into
// a JSON record. You usually want that for transferring JSON data via computer networks or
// for saving it on disk. Unmarshaling is the process of converting a JSON record given as
// a byte slice into a Go structure.

// Imagine that you have a Go structure that you want to convert into a JSON record
// without including any empty fieldsâ€” you can do that with the use of omitempty

// Last, imagine that you have some sensitive data on some of the fields of a Go
// structure that you do not want to include in the JSON records. You can do that by
// including the "-" special value in the desired json: structure tags.
