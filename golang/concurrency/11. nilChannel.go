// nil channels always block! Therefore, you should use them when you want that
// behavior on purpose!

// The send() function keeps sending random numbers to the c channel. Do not
// confuse channel c, which is a channel function parameter, with channel t.C, which is
// part of timer tâ€”you can change the name of the c variable but not the name of the C
// field. When the time of timer t expires, the timer sends a value to the t.C channel.

// This triggers the execution of the relevant branch of the select statement, which
// assigns the value nil to channel c, prints the value of the sum variable and wg.Done()
// is executed, which is going to unblock wg.Wait() found in the main() function.
// Additionally, as c becomes nil, it stops/blocks send() from sending any data to it.
