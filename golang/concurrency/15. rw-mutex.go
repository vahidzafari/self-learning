// sync.RWMutex is based on sync.Mutex with the necessary additions and improvements.
// So, you might ask, how does sync.RWMutex improve sync.Mutex? Although a single
// function is allowed to perform write operations with a sync. RWMutex mutex, you
// can have multiple readers owning a sync.RWMutex mutexâ€”this means that read
// operations are usually faster with sync.RWMutex. However, there is one important
// detail that you should be aware of: until all of the readers of a sync.RWMutex
// mutex unlock that mutex, you cannot lock it for writing, which is the small price
// you have to pay for the performance improvement you get for allowing multiple readers.

// The functions that can help you to work with sync.RWMutex are RLock() and
// RUnlock(), which are used for locking and unlocking the mutex for reading
// purposes, respectively. The Lock() and Unlock() functions used in sync.Mutex
// should still be used when you want to lock and unlock a sync.RWMutex mutex for
// writing purposes. Finally, it should be apparent that you should not make changes to
// any shared variables inside an RLock() and RUnlock() block of code.
