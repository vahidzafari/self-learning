# Functions

## Special Functions

This provides the hash of the given block number as bytes32. This function will only work for the most recent 256 blocks, excluding the current block. Hence, use this function carefully.

```sol
blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)
```

This provides the remaining gas left in the transaction as a uint256 value.

```sol
gasleft() returns (uint256)
```

## Cryptographic Functions

This is also called Ethereum SHA3. This computes the Ethereum-SHA-3 (Keccak-256) hash of the tightly packed arguments and returns it as bytes32.

```sol
keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)
```

This computes the SHA-256 hash of the input bytes and returns it as bytes32.

```sol
sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)
```

Recovers the address associated with the public key from an elliptic curve signature or returns 0 on error.

```sol
ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)
```
